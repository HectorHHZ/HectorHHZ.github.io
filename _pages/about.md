I am currently a second-year master's student at New York University majoring in Computer Engineering. I worked with Prof. Anna Choromanska and Prof. Dube Parijat. Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK) advised by Prof. David Zhang and Prof. Rui Huang. My research interests are distributed machine learning/ applied machine learning/ federated machine learning. Currently, My research mainly focuses on accelerating the convergence speed of distributed machine learning systems using novel system schemes and machine learning methods. I will graduate from NYU in May 2023 and intend to apply for Ph.D. ECE/CS programs.

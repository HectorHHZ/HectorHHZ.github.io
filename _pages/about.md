I am currently a second-year master's student at New York University majoring in Computer Engineering. I worked with Prof. Anna Choromanska and Prof. Dube Parijat. Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK) advised by Prof. David Zhang and Prof. Rui Huang. My research interests are distributed machine learning/ applied machine learning/ federated machine learning. Currently, My research mainly focuses on accelerating the convergence speed of distributed machine learning systems using novel system schemes and machine learning methods. I will graduate from NYU in May 2023 and intend to apply for Ph.D. ECE/CS programs.

Open-Source Resources
======

- Built an **open-source/general [framework]((https://github.com/HectorHHZ/Adjacent_Leader_Dencentralized_SGD))** for anyone interested in distributed machine learning. Using this framework, you can implement any centralized/ decentralized, synchronous/ asynchronous distributed SGD algorithms. In addition, this framework provides you a continent way to fulfill any network topology for decentralized SGD.
- Build an **open-source [website]([HectorHHZ/NYU-Course-Schedule (github.com)](https://github.com/HectorHHZ/NYU-Course-Schedule))** for NYU EECS/DS community and help **150+** NYU students **each semester**. This website summary the open-source courses in NYU EECS/DS, provide links and repositories for each course, list the workload, and provide course experiences for reference. Anyone from the NYU community is welcomed to fork and contribute!

I am currently a second-year master's student at New York University majoring in Computer Engineering. I worked with Prof. Anna Choromanska and Prof. Dube Parijat. Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK) advised by Prof. David Zhang and Prof. Rui Huang. My research interests are distributed machine learning/ applied machine learning/ federated machine learning. Currently, My research mainly focuses on accelerating the convergence speed of distributed machine learning systems using novel system schemes and machine learning methods. I will graduate from NYU in May 2023 and intend to apply for Ph.D. ECE/CS programs.

Open-Source Resources
======

- Built an **open-source/general [framework]((https://github.com/HectorHHZ/Adjacent_Leader_Dencentralized_SGD))** for anyone interested in distributed machine learning. Using this framework, you can implement any centralized/ decentralized, synchronous/ asynchronous distributed SGD algorithms. In addition, this framework provides you a continent way to fulfill any network topology for decentralized SGD.
- Build an **open-source [website]([HectorHHZ/NYU-Course-Schedule (github.com)](https://github.com/HectorHHZ/NYU-Course-Schedule))** for NYU EECS/DS community and help **150+** NYU students **each semester**. This website summary the open-source courses in NYU EECS/DS, provide links and repositories for each course, list the workload, and provide course experiences for reference. Anyone from the NYU community is welcomed to fork and contribute!



Startup Project
======

In **2017** when I was a sophomore undergraduate student, I found that biometric locks on sale in  the market are expensive and inconvenient: biological characters verification facilities on the hardware increase the budget, additional modifications to the hardware are inevitable when new tenants come. Therefore, I decided to form a team to design an  intelligent locking control system combining smartphone, hardware lock, and  biometric features. As the **first** company in mainland China which produce intelligent locking control system, our products are amazing. With our products, users can not only use their biological  characteristics, the APP and the specific phone to unlock doors but also authorize the  access right and access time to visitors on their phone readily. This amazing system  offered people more convenience and security as well as lowered the cost to 15%,  since it reduced the hardware cost. As the CTO in our team, I guarantee the whole  system was secure and considered every bug. For instance, since the access time and  access right verification were processed on visitors’ smartphone before generating the  QR codes, visitors may modify the local time on their smartphone to extend the  access time. To avoid this bug, we set a function of time verification on the hardware  to double check it. Besides, unchanged QR codes may be stolen by screenshot, so we  design the QR codes to be changed in a certain timescale.  We attend several competition in 2017 and 2018 and received 500,00 dollars venture capital from Shenzhen Galaxy Holding  Group.
